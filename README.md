## TODO

1. Get asymptotic benchmark normalization working again.
1. Add the ability to profile memory.
1. Add two new actions: profile and analyze for single-function runs with memory profiling.
1. Allow user change constant factor on comparison functions to asymptotic benchmarks.
1. Don't hard-code iterations in workbench-details.
1. Allow range to be a generator, rather than an array.
