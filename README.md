# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repo contains a tool for visualizing the relative running times of algorithms for various input sizes.

## TODO

1. Get asymptotic benchmark calculation working again.
1. Allow user change constant factor on comparison functions to asymptotic benchmarks.
1. Don't hard-code iterations in workbench-details.
